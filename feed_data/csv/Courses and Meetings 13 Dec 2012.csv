Is your health on the top of your to do list ? If you don't take time for your health now, then you will have to take time for illness later!_x000d_
_x000d_
Learn Reiki TODAY. Reiki enables you to heal yourself and others, without effort or study. Reiki is one of the most powerful and effective forms of natural healing and enables you to create real magic in your life each day. Usui Reiki 1 attunement is life changing in so many positive ways.

This price includes very detailed manual covering Reiki, Colour Therapy, Crystals, Chakra’s and how you can use them to improve your health & well-being and balance your Life and ongoing support.

_x000d_
The distant attunement is available the same day. No time required whatsoever. No examination, no learning or study time. The only time you really learn about Reiki and energy is by practising healing, by simply placing your hands close to or on yourself or others. _x000d_
_x000d_
Reasons to learn Reiki_x000d_
Reiki connects you to universal energy so you can heal yourself whenever you feel the need. You can balance your body, mind and spirit by spending some time each day devoted to self-healing. _x000d_
_x000d_
If you are feeling that there is something missing in your life that you can’t quite pin point, chances are that it’s your spirituality. By learning Reiki you are re-connected to your higher self, which means you will become far more intuitive, enabling you to make better decisions and to feel far more ‘whole’._x000d_
_x000d_
Stress is recognised as a major contributor to so many illnesses in modern society. Reiki has an extremely calming effect, filling you with a sense of inner peace and serenity that will ensure that stress won’t rule your life. You will gain a sense of real self-purpose and inner clarity that may have eluded you previously. _x000d_
_x000d_
Our lifestyles are incredibly busy and this takes a toll on our bodies as well as other areas of our life. Through continual self-healing at a physical level you can not only help to prevent illnesses occurring but you can use Reiki on actual physical injuries and problems from mild back pain to cancer. Reiki can help with any illness. _x000d_
_x000d_
If you feel that your life lacks direction learning Reiki re-connects you with your true purpose in life and will leave you feeling far more focused about where you need to be heading and directing all your precious resources. Many people spend years feeling they are in the wrong job or wrong situation and Reiki opens your mind up to the things that you really need, perhaps not want but need. There is nothing quite so liberating. _x000d_
_x000d_
Many people often feel that they are taking so much from life and yet giving so little back and are completely unsure of how to rectify this situation. If you take a Reiki course to practitioner level you are able to heal others as well as yourself. There is nothing quite like healing other people to make you appreciate your own situation and bring comfort to your life. There is nothing more rewarding than being able to share your gift of healing helping someone else who so desperately needs it and bringing happiness to someone else’s life. _x000d_
_x000d_
Reiki has the potential to turn your whole life around for the better if you self heal every day and listen to your intuition. Your whole life becomes clearer and you really do realise what is important in life and what you can do without. Everything is put into perspective and you learn to appreciate so many things and really learn who are your friends and who are just using you. _x000d_
_x000d_
Most people have emotional traumas in their life and what many do not realise is that the energy from these traumas is carried with you and has a negative effect on you, possibly for your whole life. Our traumas hold us back in life stalling self-development. By using Reiki on yourself you can remove the energy attached to those traumas so you will no longer feel any pain associated with the event. Once this has been achieved you are finally free to be yourself. _x000d_

It is easy to get trapped in the cycle of old lifestyle patterns and issues, for example: following the same faddy diets that don’t work, making new years resolutions you know you will break every year, getting trapped by financial issues, working too hard, struggling in relationships. This can continue for your whole life. Reiki can change the way you deal with life, the way you deal with situations and relationships in a way that is much healthier for you. It might not happen in a conscious way but you will find that for instance someone who takes advantage of you normally will get a shock when you defend yourself and demand greater respect. You learn to love yourself more and also to love others but in a way that allows them to learn their lessons and never take you for granted. _x000d_

The founder of Reiki Mikao Usui said that Reiki was the ‘art of inviting happiness’. This is very true. If you ask anyone if they are honestly really happy I doubt you will get a resounding yes from the majority. People often misconceive what real happiness is and associate it with wealth, material possessions or a successful career. Happiness is about so much more than that. Happiness comes from a profound understanding of the universe and knowing your place in the universe. If you choose to learn Reiki you will be set on the path to enlightenment. For some this is a short path, for others a much longer one but once you know you are on it you find what happiness is. Reiki is more than just a therapy it is the way of the universe._x000d_

We take care of our vehicle’s and maintain them with services and place fuel in them constantly to maintain optimum performance. Yet each day what do we do to maintain our own bodies? We seem to think that they will continue to work efficiently and effectively each day without even once giving them a second thought, as though there is an endless supply and the next breath will be there without question. What measures do we take to provide our own bodies with the right conditions to enable them to heal themselves? Don’t put your health on the bottom of your to do list and start to listen to your own body. Nobody on this planet knows your body better than you.",15,"A",22/07/2010,09/08/2010,120682

The specific themes for 2011 are bone healing in the mechanical environment of new plating systems, foot and ankle for the general trauma surgeon and spines for those who don’t do spines.  We wish to explore these concepts within a framework of how we educate our trainees.  _x000d_
_x000d_
The aims of Day 1 are firstly to re-establish the foundations of fracture management and then move through the evolution of treatment and the use of modern implants. The practical examples used will be plating systems and MIPO.  However, instead of a didactic format we will interweave this with discussion on how we learn, teach and assess practical skills. In the coming era of recertification these issues will become more relevant to all of us._x000d_

On Day 2 the management of challenging mid- and hind-foot fractures that present to and challenge the general trauma surgeon will form the core; with talks, practicals and discussions. There has been a rapid proliferation and evolution in the interventional treatment for these challenging injuries; a technical update is therefore one objective. This will be balanced with discussion on management choices _x000d_

Day 3 will cover the general aspects of spinal fracture care. Particular emphasis will be on those fractures presenting to the General T&O Surgeon. The aim is to up-date the generalist with information on the current state of management and surgery for these patients._x000d_

Within the scientific community, it is widely considered that knowledge from musculoskeletal healing and medical therapies can be transferred into strategies for prevention of musculoskeletal injury and degeneration, as well as deterioration of neuromotor and cardiovascular control. _x000d_
However, the scientific evidence for such a conceptual approach is still unclear. _x000d_
  _x000d_
To become effective, prevention strategies require an understanding of a number of relevant disciplines including kinematics/kinetics, biology/biochemistry, medicine, bio-technological sciences and patient nutrition. Here, understanding the underlying molecular processes, cellular responses and structural consequences is essential for a science based approach to effective prevention. _x000d_

The two day course is constructed around five sessions of dissection of unpreserved cadaveric tissue. These limbs are obtained through a structured formal donor scheme. They have been chosen because they are unpreserved and therefore closely simulate the conditions in the surgical field._x000d_
_x000d_
All dissection is performed by prosector members of Faculty._x000d_
_x000d_
Each prosector is seated with a maximum of seven participants. The dissection will cover all structures of the upper limb and will focus particularly on the application to Surgery and to rehabilitation. There is ample scope for discussion during the dissection. Participants will assist prosectors and will have opportunity to direct the discussion along relevant lines._x000d_
_x000d_
Each day starts with a presentation of a one hour video covering the entire dissection for that day. This will serve to revise the material before the dissection sessions. The day’s dissection will then cover the same ground._x000d_
